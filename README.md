# noontide-specification
An ongoing effort to design the Noontide SUBLEQ Computer.

# The CPU
The CPU is identical to that of the Dawn OS design. The following is its original description:  
64-bit big-endian SUBLEQ CPU. The opcodes are stored in ABC format, and they operate in the following way (pseudocode):

```c
long long A=GET_64_BIT_DATA(eip);
long long B=GET_64_BIT_DATA(eip+8);
long long C=GET_64_BIT_DATA(eip+16);
long long value_of_b=GET_64_BIT_DATA(B)-GET_64_BIT_DATA(A);
STORE_64_BIT_DATA(value_of_b, B);
if(value_of_b<=0){
 eip=C;
}else{
 eip+=24;
}
```

The instruction uses fixed memory addresses. The eip of the first core is 0 on boot.

# Memory Layout
0x00000000-0x10000000 Boot sector  
0x10000000-0x14000000 Hardware I/O  
0x13ED27E0-0x13ED27E8 Serial connected (1 if connected, 0 otherwise)  
0x13ED27E8-0x13ED27F0 Serial input (In 1-indexed Unicode. That is, put 11 instead of 10 when a newline is fed. Must be set to 0 after reading)  
0x13ED27F0-0x13ED27F8 Serial output (In 1-indexed Unicode. Must be set to 0 by the serial after outputting)

This specification is heavily inspired by the work of Geri and their Dawn operating system.
